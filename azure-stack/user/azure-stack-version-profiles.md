# Manage API version profiles in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

API profiles specify the Azure resource provider and the API version for Azure REST endpoints. You can create custom clients in different languages using API profiles. Each client uses an API profile to contact the right resource provider and API version for Azure Stack.

This topic helps you:
 - Understand API profiles for Azure Stack.
 - How you can use API profiles to develop your solutions.
 - Where to look for code-specific guidance.

## Azure Resource Manager API profiles

You can use profiles to specify a set of resource providers and API versions. Instead of specifying individual API-versions for each individual resource provider, you can align the application to a profile. The SDK, or a tool built with the SDK, will revert to the target api-version specified in the profile. With API profiles, you can specify a profile version that applies to an entire template and, at runtime, the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) selects the right version of the resource.

API profiles work with tools that use ARM, such as PowerShell, Azure CLI, code provided in the SDK, and Microsoft Visual Studio. Tools and SDKs can use profiles to read which version of the modules and libraries to include when building an application.

For example, if use PowerShell to create a storage account using the **Microsoft.Storage** resource provider, which supports api-version 2016-03-30 and a VM using the Microsoft.Compute resource provider with api-version 2015-12-01, you would need to look up  which PowerShell Module supports 2016-03-30 for Storage and which Module supports 2015-02-01 for Compute and install them. Instead, you can use a profile. Use the cmdlet **Install-Profile *profilename***, and PowerShell loads the right version of the modules.

Similarly, when using the Python SDK to build a Python-based application, you can specify the profile. The SDK loads the right modules for the resource providers that you have specified in your script.

As a developer, you can focus on writing your solution. Rather than researching which api-versions, resource provider, and which cloud works together, you use a profile and know that your code will work across all clouds that support that profile.

## Using API profiles with Azure Stack

An Azure resource provider supplies resources you can deploy and manage through the Azure Resource Manager. Each provider offers operations for working with resources. Some common resource providers include Microsoft.Compute, which supplies virtual machines, Microsoft.Storage, which supplies storage account resources, and Microsoft.Web, which supplies resources related to web apps. For more information, see [Resource providers and types](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services).

The following table for each resource provider indicates the supported version of the API version for Azure Stack.

### Microsoft.Authorization

You use role-based access control to manage the actions users in your organization can take on resources. This set of operations enables you to define roles, assign roles to users or groups, and get information about permissions. For more information, see [Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/authorization/).

## API profile code samples

You can find code samples to help you integrate your solution with your preferred language with Azure Stack by using profiles. Currently, you can find guidance and samples for the following languages:

- **PowerShell**  
You can use the  **AzureRM.Bootstrapper** module available through the PowerShell Gallery to get the PowerShell cmdlets required to work with API version profiles.  For more information, see [Use API version profiles for PowerShell](azure-stack-version-profiles-powershell.md).
- **Azure CLI 2.0**  
For more information see [Use API version profiles for Azure CLI 2.0](azure-stack-version-profiles-azurecli2.md).
- **GO**  
For more information see [Use API version profiles for GO](azure-stack-version-profiles-go.md).
