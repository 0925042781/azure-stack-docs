# Create a Windows virtual machine by using CLI in Azure Stack

Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure Stack resources from the command line. This guide details using Azure CLI to create a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine in Azure Stack. You can run the steps described in this article either from the [Azure Stack Development Kit](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-remote-desktop), or from a Windows-based external client if you are [connected through VPN](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-vpn)

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure your Azure Stack operator has added the Windows Server 2016 image to the Azure Stack marketplace. 
2. Azure Stack requires the 2.0 version of Azure CLI to create and manage the resources. Use the steps described in [Install and configure CLI](azure-stack-connect-cli.md) topic to install the required version.  
3. Make sure that your Azure Stack cloud administrator has [set up a public endpoint that contains the virtual machine image aliases](azure-stack-connect-cli.md#set-up-the-virtual-machine-aliases-endpoint).

## Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical container into which Azure Stack resources are deployed and managed. Use the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command to create a resource group. We have assigned values for all variables in this document, you can use them as is or assign a different value. 
The following example creates a resource group named myResourceGroup in the local location.

```cli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location local
```

## Create a virtual machine

Create a VM by using the [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#create) command. The following example creates a VM named myVM. This example uses Demouser for an administrative user name and Demouser@123 as the password. Update these values to something appropriate to your environment. These values are needed when connecting to the virtual machine.

```cli
az vm create \
  --resource-group "myResourceGroup" \
  --name "myVM" \
  --image "Win2016Datacenter" \
  --admin-username "Demouser" \
  --admin-password "Demouser@123" \
  --use-unmanaged-disk \
  --location local
```

When the VM is created, you should see the output that is similar to the following example. Make note of the publicIpAaddress, which you will use to access the VM.
 
## Open port 80 for web traffic

By default, only RDP connections are allowed to a Windows virtual machine deployed in Azure Stack. If this VM is going to be a webserver, you need to open port 80 from the Internet. Use the [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/vm#open-port) command to open the desired port.

```cli
az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

## Connect to virtual machine

Use the following command to create a remote desktop session with the virtual machine. Replace the IP address with the public IP address of your virtual machine. When prompted, enter the credentials used when creating the virtual machine.

```
mstsc /v <Public IP Address>
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#delete) command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```cli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
