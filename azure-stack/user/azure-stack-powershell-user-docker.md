# Use Docker to run PowerShell

You can use Docker to create Windows-based containers on which to run the specific version of PowerShell needed to work the different interfaces. You must be using Windows-based containers in Docker.

## Docker prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
2. Open a command line, such as Powershell or Bash and type:

    ```bash
        Docker â€“version to check that you have it installed.
    ```

3. You will need to run Docker using Windows containers that will require Windows 10. When running Docker, switch to Windows containers.

4. You will need to run Docker from a machine joined to the same domain as Azure Stack. If you are using the ASDK, you will need to install [the VPN on your remote machine](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-vpn).

## Docker - Azure Stack API Profiles module

The Dockerfile opens the Microsoft image microsoft/windowsservercore which has Windows PowerShell 5.1 installed. The file then loads Nuget, the Azure Stack PowerShell modules, and grabs the tools from Azure Stack Tools.

1. Download this repository as a ZIP or clone the repository:  
[https://github.com/mattbriggs/azure-stack-powershell](https://github.com/mattbriggs/azure-stack-powershell)

2. Open the repository folder from your terminal.

3. Open a command-line interface on and type:

    ```bash  
    docker build --tag azure-stack-powershell .
    ```

4. When the image has been built, you can start an interactive container. Type:

    ```bash  
        docker run -it azure-stack-powershell powershell
    ```

5. The shell is ready for your cmdlets.

    ```bash
    Windows PowerShell

    PS C:\>
    ```

## Docker - PowerShell 6.1

You can find the Microsoft maintained docker image at: https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-powershell.

Open a command-line interface on and type:

```bash
docker run -it microsoft/powershell
```
