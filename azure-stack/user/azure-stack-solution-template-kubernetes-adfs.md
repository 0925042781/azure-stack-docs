# Deploy Kubernetes to Azure Stack using Active Directory Federated Services

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

> [!Note]  
> Kubernetes on Azure Stack is in preview.

You can follow the steps in this article to deploy and set up the resources for Kubernetes, when using Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) as your as your identity management service, in a single, coordinated operation.

## Prerequisites 

To get started, make sure you have the right permissions and that your Azure Stack is ready.

1. Generate an SSH public and private key pair to sign in to the Linux VM on Azure Stack. You will need the public key when creating the cluster.

    For instructions on generating a key, see [SSH Key Generation](https://github.com/msazurestackworkloads/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/ssh.md#ssh-key-generation).

1. Check that you have a valid subscription in your Azure Stack tenant portal, and that you have enough public IP addresses available to add new applications.

    The cluster cannot be deployed to an Azure Stack **Administrator** subscription. You must use a **User** subscription. 

1. If you do not have Kubernetes Cluster in your marketplace, talk to your Azure Stack administrator.

## Create a service principal

You will need to work with your Azure Stack administrator to set up your service principal when using AD FS as your identity solution. The service principal gives your application access to Azure Stack resources.

1. Your Azure Stack administrator will provide you with the following pieces of information:

    | Value | Description |
    | ---   | ----        |
    | service Principal application ID. | The unique ID for the service principle. |
    | service principle key | A secret generated by the Azure Stack administrator when creating the service principle. |
    | certificate path | The FQDN or file path to the certificate. |
    | certificate password | The certificate password. |
    | key vault name |  Name of the vault.<br> Regex pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{3,24}$` |
    | ApplicationName | The name of the application that refernces the service principal. |

2. Upload service principle certificate to Key Vault.

    To upload your certificate to the key vault, run the following cmdlets:

    ```PowerShell  
    $tempPFXFilePath = "<certificate path>" 
    $password = "<certificate password>" 
    $keyVaultSecretName = "<key Vault secret name>" 
    $certContentInBytes = [io.file]::ReadAllBytes($tempPFXFilePath) 
    $pfxAsBase64EncodedString = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($certContentInBytes) 
    $jsonObject = @" 
    { 
    "data": "$pfxAsBase64EncodedString", 
    "dataType" :"pfx", 
    "password": "$password" 
    } 
    "@ 
    $jsonObjectBytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($jsonObject) 
    $jsonEncoded = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($jsonObjectBytes) 
    $secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $jsonEncoded -AsPlainText -Force 
    $keyVaultSecret = Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName <key vault name > -Name $keyVaultSecretName -SecretValue $secret
    ```

## Give the service principal access

Give the service principal access to your subscription so that the principal can create resources.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Stack portal](https://portal.local.azurestack.external/).

1. Select **All services** > **Subscriptions**.

1. Select the subscription created by your operator for using the Kubernetes Cluster.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)** > Select **Add role assignment**.

1. Select the **Contributor** role.

1. Select the application name created for your service principal. You may have to type the name in the search box.

1. Click **Save**.

## Deploy Kubernetes

1. Open the [Azure Stack portal](https://portal.local.azurestack.external).

1. Select **+ Create a resource** > **Compute** > **Kubernetes Cluster**. Click **Create**.

### 1. Basics

1. Select **Basics** in Create Kubernetes Cluster.

    ![Deploy Solution Template](media/azure-stack-solution-template-kubernetes-deploy/02_kub_config_basic.png)

1. Select your **Subscription** ID.

1. Enter the name of a new resource group or select an existing resource group. The resource name needs to be alphanumeric and lowercase.

1. Select the **Location** of the resource group. This is the region you choose for your Azure Stack installation.

### 2. Kubernetes Cluster Settings

1. Select **Kubernetes Cluster Settings** in Create Kubernetes Cluster.

    ![Deploy Solution Template](media/azure-stack-solution-template-kubernetes-deploy/03_kub_config_settings-adfs.png)

1. Enter the **Linux VM Admin Username**. User name for the Linux Virtual Machines that are part of the Kubernetes cluster and DVM.

1. Enter the **SSH Public Key** used for authorization to all Linux machines created as part of the Kubernetes cluster and DVM.

1. Enter the **Master Profile DNS Prefix** that is unique to the region. This must be a region-unique name, such as `k8s-12345`. Try to chose it same as the resource group name as best practice.

    > [!Note]  
    > For each cluster, use a new and unique master profile DNS prefix.

1. Select the **Kubernetes Master Pool Profile Count**. The count contains the number of nodes in the master pool. There can be from 1 to 7. This value should be an odd number.

1. Select **The VMSize of the Kubernetes master VMs**.

1. Select the **Kubernetes Node Pool Profile Count**. The count contains the number of agents in the cluster. 

1. Select the **Storage Profile**. You can choose **Blob Disk** or **Managed Disk**. This specifies the VM Size of Kubernetes node VMs. 

1. Select **ADFS** for the **Azure Stack identity system** for your Azure Stack installation.

1. Enter the **Service Principal ClientId** This is used by the Kubernetes Azure cloud provider. The Client ID identified as the Application ID when your Azure Stack administrator created the service principal.

1. Enter the **Service principle certificate Key Vault Id** where your certificate is stored.

1. Add the ***Service principle certificate secret name** where the certificate is stored. 

1. Enter the **Kubernetes Azure Cloud Provider Version**. This is the version for the Kubernetes Azure provider. Azure Stack releases a custom Kubernetes build for each Azure Stack version.

### 3. Summary

1. Select Summary. The blade displays a validation message for your Kubernetes Cluster configurations settings.

2. Review your settings.

3. Select **OK** to deploy your cluster.

> [!TIP]  
>  If you have questions about your deployment, you can post your question or see if someone has already answered the question in the [Azure Stack Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/home?forum=azurestack).
