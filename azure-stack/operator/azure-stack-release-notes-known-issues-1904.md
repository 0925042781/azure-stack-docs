### Virtual machine scale set

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases
- Cause: The Virtual Machine Scale Set creation experience provides CentOS-based 7.2 as an option for deployment. CentOS 7.2 is not available on Azure Stack.

- Occurrence: Common

### Managed disks

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases

- Remediation: Follow these steps for each subscription:
  - In the Tenant portal, go to Subscriptions and find the subscription. Select Resource Providers, then select Microsoft.Compute, and then click Re-register.
  - Under the same subscription, go to Access Control (IAM), and verify that Azure Stack â€“ Managed Disk is listed.

## Infrastructure backup

<!--Bug 3615401 - scheduler config lost; new issue in YYMM;  hectorl-->
After enabling automatic backups, the scheduler service goes into disabled state unexpectedly. The backup controller service will detect that automatic backups are disabled and raise a warning in the administrator portal. This warning is expected when automatic backups are disabled.

- Applicable: This is a new issue with release 1904.
- Cause: This issue is due to a bug in the service that results in loss of scheduler configuration. This bug does not change the storage location, user name, password, or encryption key.
- Remediation: To mitigate this issue, open the backup controller settings blade in the Infrastructure Backup resource provider and select **Enable Automatic Backups**. Make sure to set the desired frequency and retention period.
- Occurrence: Low
