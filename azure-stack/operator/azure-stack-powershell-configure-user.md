# Configure PowerShell in Azure Stack for the user environment

This article describes the steps required to connect to an Azure Stack Development Kit instance by using PowerShell. After you connect, you can access the portal and deploy resources through PowerShell. This topic is scoped to use with the user environments only, if you want to set up PowerShell for the cloud operator environment, refer to the [Configure PowerShell for the cloud operator environment](azure-stack-powershell-configure-admin.md) topic. You can use the steps described in this article either from the development kit, or from a Windows-based external client if you are connected through VPN. 

This article has detailed instructions to configure PowerShell for Azure Stack. However, if you want to quickly install and configure PowerShell, you can use the script provided in the [Get up and running with PowerShell](azure-stack-powershell-configure-quickstart.md) topic. 

## Prerequisites

* Install [Azure Stack-compatible Azure PowerShell modules](azure-stack-powershell-install.md).  
* Download the [tools required to work with Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-download.md).  

## Import the Connect PowerShell module

After you download the required tools, navigate to the downloaded folder and import the **Connect** PowerShell module. To import the Connect module, run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Import-Module .\Connect\AzureStack.Connect.psm1
```

## Configure the PowerShell environment and sign in to Azure Stack

Based on the type of deployment (Azure AD or AD FS), run one of the following script to configure PowerShell for Azure Stack:

* **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**
       
  ```powershell
  # Register an AzureRM environment that targets your Azure Stack instance
  Add-AzureRMEnvironment `
    -Name "AzureStackUser" `
    -ArmEndpoint "https://management.local.azurestack.external"

  # Set the GraphEndpointResourceId value
  Set-AzureRmEnvironment `
    -Name "AzureStackUser" `
    -GraphAudience "https://graph.windows.net/"

  # Get the Active Directory tenantId that is used to deploy Azure Stack
  $TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
    -AADTenantName "<myDirectoryTenantName>.onmicrosoft.com" `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser"

  # Sign in to your environment
  Login-AzureRmAccount `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser" `
    -TenantId $TenantID 
   ```

* **Active Directory Federation Services**
          
  ```powershell
  # Register an AzureRM environment that targets your Azure Stack instance
  Add-AzureRMEnvironment `
    -Name "AzureStackUser" `
    -ArmEndpoint "https://management.local.azurestack.external"

  # Set the GraphEndpointResourceId value
  Set-AzureRmEnvironment `
    -Name "AzureStackUser" `
    -GraphAudience "https://graph.local.azurestack.external/" `
    -EnableAdfsAuthentication:$true

  # Get the Active Directory tenantId that is used to deploy Azure Stack     
  $TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
    -ADFS `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser"

  # Sign in to your environment
  Login-AzureRmAccount `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser" `
    -TenantId $TenantID 
  ```

## Register resource providers

When operating on a newly created user subscription that doesnâ€™t have any resources deployed through the portal, the resource providers aren't automatically registered. You should explicitly register them by using the following script:

```powershell

foreach($s in (Get-AzureRmSubscription)) {
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId $s.SubscriptionId | Out-Null
        Write-Progress $($s.SubscriptionId + " : " + $s.SubscriptionName)
Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ListAvailable | Register-AzureRmResourceProvider -Force
    } 
```
