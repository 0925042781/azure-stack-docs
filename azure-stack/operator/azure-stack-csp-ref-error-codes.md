| RegistrationNotFound            | The provided registration was not found. Please make sure the following information was provided correctly: 1. Subscription Identifier (value provided: <subscription identifier>), 2. Resource Group (value provided: <resource group>), 3. Registration Name (value provided: <registration name>).                             | This error usually occurs when the information pointing to the initial registration is not correct. If you need to verify the resource group and name of your registration, you can find it in the Azure portal, by listing all resources. If you find more than one registration resource, look at the CloudDeploymentID in the properties, and select the registration whose CloudDeploymentID matches that of your cloud. To find the CloudDeploymentID, you can use this PowerShell on the Azure Stack: $azureStackStampInfo = Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { Get-AzureStackStampInformation } |
| BadCustomerSubscriptionId       | The provided Customer Subscription Identifier <customer subscription identifier> and the registration <registration name> Subscription Identifier are not owned by the same Microsoft Cloud Service Provider. Please check that the Customer Subscription Identifier is correct. If the problem persists, please contact support. | This error occurs when the customer subscription is a CSP subscription, but it rolls up to a CSP partner different from the one to which the subscription used in the initial registration rolls up. This check is made to prevent a situation that would result in billing a CSP partner who is not responsible for the Azure Stack used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
