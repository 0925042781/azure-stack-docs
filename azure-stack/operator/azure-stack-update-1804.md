# Azure Stack 1804 update

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

This article describes the improvements and fixes in the 1804 update package, known issues for this release, and where to download the update. Known issues are divided into issues directly related to the update process and issues with the build (post-installation).

> [!IMPORTANT]        
> This update package is only for Azure Stack integrated systems. Do not apply this update package to the Azure Stack Development Kit.

## Build reference    
The Azure Stack 1804 update build number is **201804xx.x**.

### New features and fixes
This update includes the following improvements and fixes for Azure Stack.

- <!--    --> **feature name 1** 

- <!--    --> **feature name 2**  

- <!--    --> **feature name 3** 
 
- **Various fixes** for performance, stability, security, and the operating system that is used by Azure Stack.

### Changes
- <!--    --> Change 1




## Before you begin    



### Prerequisites
- Install the Azure Stack [1803 Update](azure-stack-update-1803.md) before you apply the Azure Stack 1804 update.    

### Known issues with the update process   

- <!-- TBD - IS --> Do not attempt to create virtual machines during the installation of this update. For more information about managing updates, see [Manage updates in Azure Stack overview](azure-stack-updates.md#plan-for-updates).
 
- <!-- 2328416 --> During installation of the 1804 update, there can be downtime of the blob service and internal services that use blob service. This includes some virtual machine operations. This down time can cause failures of tenant operations or alerts from services that can’t access data. This issue resolves itself when the update completes installation. 

### Post-update steps
*There are no post-update steps for update 1804.*

### Known issues (post-installation)
The following are post-installation known issues for build  **201804xx.x**.

#### Portal
- <!-- TBD -  IS ASDK -->The ability [to open a new support request from the dropdown](azure-stack-manage-portals.md#quick-access-to-help-and-support) from within the administrator portal isn’t available. Instead, use the following link:     
    - For Azure Stack integrated systems, use https://aka.ms/newsupportrequest.

- <!-- 2050709 - IS ASDK --> In the admin portal, it is not possible to edit storage metrics for Blob service, Table service, or Queue service. When you go to Storage, and then select the blob, table, or queue service tile, a new blade opens that displays a metrics chart for that service. If you then select Edit from the top of the metrics chart tile, the Edit Chart blade opens but does not display options to edit metrics.

- <!-- TBD - IS --> It might not be possible to view compute or storage resources in the administrator portal. The cause of this issue is an error during the installation of the update that causes the update to be incorrectly reported as successful. If this issue occurs, contact Microsoft Customer Support Services for assistance.

- <!-- TBD - IS --> You might see a blank dashboard in the portal. To recover the dashboard, select the gear icon in the upper right corner of the portal, and then select **Restore default settings**.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> When you view the properties of a resource or resource group, the **Move** button is disabled. This behavior is expected. Moving resources or resource groups between resource groups or subscriptions is not currently supported.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> Deleting user subscriptions results in orphaned resources. As a workaround, first delete user resources or the entire resource group, and then delete user subscriptions.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> You cannot view permissions to your subscription using the Azure Stack portals. As a workaround, use PowerShell to verify permissions.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> In the dashboard of the admin portal, the Update tile fails to display information about updates. To resolve this issue, click on the tile to refresh it.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> In the admin portal, you might see a critical alert for the *Microsoft.Update.Admin* component. The Alert name, description, and remediation all display as:  
    - *ERROR - Template for FaultType ResourceProviderTimeout is missing.*

  This alert can be safely ignored. 

<!-- #### Health and monitoring --> 
<!-- #### Marketplace --> 

#### Compute
- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> Scaling settings for virtual machine scale sets are not available in the portal. As a workaround, you can use [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-manage-powershell#change-the-capacity-of-a-scale-set). Because of PowerShell version differences, you must use the `-Name` parameter instead of `-VMScaleSetName`.

- <!-- TBD - IS --> When you create an availability set in the portal by going to **New** > **Compute** > **Availability set**, you can only create an availability set with a fault domain and update domain of 1. As a workaround, when creating a new virtual machine, create the availability set by using PowerShell, CLI, or from within the portal.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> When you create virtual machines on the Azure Stack user portal, the portal displays an incorrect number of data disks that can attach to a DS series VM. DS series VMs can accommodate as many data disks as the Azure configuration.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> When a VM image fails to be created, a failed item that you cannot delete might be added to the VM images compute blade.

  As a workaround, create a new VM image with a dummy VHD that can be created through Hyper-V (New-VHD -Path C:\dummy.vhd -Fixed -SizeBytes 1 GB). This process should fix the problem that prevents deleting the failed item. Then, 15 minutes after creating the dummy image, you can successfully delete it.

  You can then try to redownload the VM image that previously failed.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> If provisioning an extension on a VM deployment takes too long, users should let the provisioning time-out instead of trying to stop the process to deallocate or delete the VM.  

- <!-- 1662991 IS ASDK --> Linux VM diagnostics is not supported in Azure Stack. When you deploy a Linux VM with VM diagnostics enabled, the deployment fails. The deployment also fails if you enable the Linux VM basic metrics through diagnostic settings.  


#### Networking
- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> After a VM is created and associated with a public IP address, you can't disassociate that VM from that IP address. Disassociation appears to work, but the previously assigned public IP address remains associated with the original VM.

  Currently, you must use only new public IP addresses for new VMs you create.

  This behavior occurs even if you reassign the IP address to a new VM (commonly referred to as a *VIP swap*). All future attempts to connect through this IP address result in a connection to the originally associated VM, and not to the new one.



- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> Azure Stack supports a single *local network gateway* per IP address. This is true across all tenant subscriptions. After the creation of the first local network gateway connection, subsequent attempts to create a local network gateway resource with the same IP address are blocked.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> On a Virtual Network that was created with a DNS Server setting of *Automatic*, changing to a custom DNS Server fails. The updated settings are not pushed to VMs in that Vnet.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> Azure Stack does not support adding additional network interfaces to a VM instance after the VM is deployed. If the VM requires more than one network interface, they must be defined at deployment time.

- <!-- 2096388 - IS --> You cannot use the admin portal to update rules for a network security group. 

    Workaround for App Service: If you need to remote desktop to the Controller instances, you modify the security rules within the network security groups with PowerShell.  Following are examples of how to *allow*, and then restore the configuration to *deny*:  
    
    - *Allow:*
 
      ```powershell    
      Login-AzureRMAccount -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin
      
      $nsg = Get-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -Name "ControllersNsg" -ResourceGroupName "AppService.local"
      
      $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389 =  $nsg | Get-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name "Inbound_Rdp_3389"
      
      ##This doesn’t work. Need to set properties again even in case of edit
      
      #Set-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name "Inbound_Rdp_3389" -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg -Access Allow  
      
      Set-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg `
        -Name $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.Name `
        -Description "Inbound_Rdp_3389" `
        -Access Allow `
        -Protocol $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.Protocol `
        -Direction $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.Direction `
        -Priority $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.Priority `
        -SourceAddressPrefix $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.SourceAddressPrefix `
        -SourcePortRange $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.SourcePortRange `
        -DestinationAddressPrefix $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.DestinationAddressPrefix `
        -DestinationPortRange $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.DestinationPortRange
      
      # Commit the changes back to NSG
      Set-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg
      ```

    - *Deny:*

        ```powershell
        
        Login-AzureRMAccount -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin
        
        $nsg = Get-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -Name "ControllersNsg" -ResourceGroupName "AppService.local"
        
        $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389 =  $nsg | Get-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name "Inbound_Rdp_3389"
        
        ##This doesn’t work. Need to set properties again even in case of edit
    
        #Set-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name "Inbound_Rdp_3389" -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg -Access Allow  
    
        Set-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg `
          -Name $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.Name `
          -Description "Inbound_Rdp_3389" `
          -Access Deny `
          -Protocol $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.Protocol `
          -Direction $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.Direction `
          -Priority $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.Priority `
          -SourceAddressPrefix $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.SourceAddressPrefix `
          -SourcePortRange $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.SourcePortRange `
          -DestinationAddressPrefix $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.DestinationAddressPrefix `
          -DestinationPortRange $RuleConfig_Inbound_Rdp_3389.DestinationPortRange
          
        # Commit the changes back to NSG
        Set-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg 
        ```


#### SQL and MySQL

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> It can take up to one hour before users can create databases in a new SQL or MySQL deployment.

- <!-- TBD - IS --> Only the resource provider is supported to create items on servers that host SQL or MySQL. Items created on a host server that are not created by the resource provider might result in a mismatched state.  


> [!NOTE]  
> <!-- TBD - IS --> After you update to Azure Stack 1804, you can continue to use the SQL and MySQL resource providers that you previously deployed.  We recommend you update SQL and MySQL when a new release becomes available. Like Azure Stack, apply updates to SQL and MySQL resource providers sequentially.  For example, if you use version 1802, first apply version 1803, and then update to 1804.      
>   
> The install of update 1804 does not affect the current use of SQL or MySQL resource providers by your users.
> Regardless of the version of the resource providers you use, your users data in their databases is not touched, and remains accessible.    



#### App Service
- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> Users must register the storage resource provider before they create their first Azure Function in the subscription.

- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> In order to scale out infrastructure (workers, management, front-end roles), you must use PowerShell as described in the release notes for Compute.


#### Usage  
- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> Usage Public IP address usage meter data shows the same *EventDateTime* value for each record instead of the *TimeDate* stamp that shows when the record was created. Currently, you can’t use this data to perform accurate accounting of public IP address usage.


<!-- #### Identity -->


#### Downloading Azure Stack Tools from GitHub
- <!-- TBD - IS ASDK --> When using the *invoke-webrequest* PowerShell cmdlet to download the Azure Stack tools from Github, you receive an error:     
    -  *invoke-webrequest : The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.*     

  This error occurs because of a recent GitHub support deprecation of the Tlsv1 and Tlsv1.1 cryptographic standards (the default for PowerShell). For more information, see [Weak cryptographic standards removal notice](https://githubengineering.com/crypto-removal-notice/).

  To resolve this issue, add `[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12` to the top of the script to force the PowerShell console to use TLSv1.2 when downloading from GitHub repositories.
